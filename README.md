# Mercury Project

Mercury is an PHP Open Source eCommerce framework agnostic abstraction.

Highest details for starting to build any kind of shop in all PHP frameworks. Highest quality of code, 100% tests coverage and very flexible code. Powerful plugin abstraction that can be easily implemented in any framework.

We are really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project becomes real.

## Motivation

This project exists to provide simple interface and guides for building strong and powerful eCommerce shops. With a lot of expirience in eCommerce development and use of various systems and frameworks We came to a conclusion that all systems are very hard to use, extend or maintain. That was the most powerful reason We decide to start this project.
